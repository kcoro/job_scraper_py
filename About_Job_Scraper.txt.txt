# Use existing API's, and web scraping when required, to collect
# job postings from major job boards, Indeed, Monster etc.. and more
# targeted developer sites such as Stack Overflow.

#### The State of API Issues ####
#################################

### StackOverflow Jobs ###
# No api for the jobs portal
# Web Scraping is only option

#### GlassDoor ###
# Registration required for "partners", primarily used for monetization
# Registration is non-existent for a normal account, must require an employer account!?
# WebScraping / botting is caught by default
# Use Selenium to "fake" being a human client

### Indeed ###
# Requires Publisher Account to use API, no guarantee of acceptance without a business with web traffic
# "Client Library" for accessing API: https://github.com/indeedlabs/indeed-python
# Web Scraping may be viable without Selenium

### GitHub Jobs ###
# Almost Zero Jobs Listed! GFG
# Public API Docs: https://jobs.github.com/api
# Public access to API's, no registration required

### Monster ###
# Requires partner registration
# Web Scraping is viable, however requires navigating add'l links for each job to get description
